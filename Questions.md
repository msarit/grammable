# Lesson 13
Dont really understand the objectives for the update action; particularly the validation errors objective

# Lesson 15
In "grams#destroy action", why aren't we creating a user first before calling gram.user?
Dont understand why for the 404 error message action, we have to create a user first? But not for the other actions?

In "grams#edit action shouldn't let a user who did not create the gram edit a gram", I assume it works because gram.user isn't equal to user?
